**NOTE**: Archiving this since I moved to a [new repository](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/pod-gateway) and the [k8s community](https://github.com/k8s-at-home). I will not delete it since it was used by others
but please notice that I am also dissabling the weekly builds since the trigger docker pull limit errors and I do not want the spam nor have the
interest to upgrade the CI to use the Github container registry. IF there is interest of others please contact me in the k8s-at-home Discord.
